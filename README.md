# SlimeVR Server
Server app for SlimeVR ecosystem

Server orchestrates communication between multiple sensors and integrations, like SteamVR.

Sensors implementations:
* [SlimeVR Tracker for ESP](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-ESP) - ESP microcontrollers and multiple IMUs are supported
* [owoTrack Mobile App](https://github.com/abb128/owoTrackVRSyncMobile) - use phone as a tracker (limited functionality and copmatibility)

Integrations:
* Use [SlimeVR OpenVR Driver](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver) as a driver for SteamVR
* Integrations with other systems will be added later
